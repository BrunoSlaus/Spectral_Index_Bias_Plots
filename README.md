# Spectral_Index_Bias_Plots
Plotting the bias in spectral indices

This folder contains the codes used to create nice 
Alpha vs Flux plots that highlight the bias in Alpha
(i.e. Sp. index) from the different detection limits.

The codes were created for the XXL-N GMRT observations which
have 2 distinct parts. Therefore there are 2 plots (unless noted).

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE CODES ARE RATHER PARTICULAR IN
THEIR USE BUT THEY CAN BE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR FURTHER CODING.

Contents:
1) BIAS_Alpha_Double_MINUS.py: Inverted y-axis.

2) BIAS_Alpha_Double.py      : Main.code

3) BIAS_Alpha_SINGLE.py      : Plots only one part of the
                               field. Useful for 1-part
                               fields.
